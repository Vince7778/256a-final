// This is a test level file!
// and these are comments!
// Read this to learn how to make your own levels!

// Be careful, if you pass in a string for a numeric argument it will be parsed as 0!

// This sets the player spawnpoint.
// Only the last one in a level file is used.
// The optional third argument represents the starting rotation in degrees.

// This section creates the platforms of the level.
// All platforms have a priority, which is kinda like y-level
// except prevents z-fighting and determines collision check order.

// This is your basic gray platform.
// Arguments are priority, and x1, z1, x2, z2 describing opposite corners.
p basic 0 -2 -2 2 2
p basic 0 -1 -2 1 -6

// These are walls, which the player can't walk past
w basic -2 2 2 2
w basic -2 2 -2 -2

// You can attach walls to the most recently placed platform using | (basic walls only)
// north = -z, east = +x
